# Hi, I'm Nisarga 👋

I turn messy data into decisions people actually use.

## What I Do

I'm a **data analyst** and **CS grad student** who likes questions without obvious answers — the kind that need clean SQL, thoughtful modeling, and a story that sticks.

I work across:
- **Analytics & Reporting** → SQL, Python, dashboards that answer "why" not just "what"
- **Modeling & ML** → Classification, regression, forecasting with emphasis on interpretability
- **Anomaly Detection** → Finding the weird stuff that matters in noisy data
- **Decision Support** → Turning analysis into action for business, product, and ops teams

## Recent Work

**[Fake Review Detection](https://github.com/nisargakadam/Influence-of-Fake-Reviews-on-Quality-Amazon-Product-Recommendation)** → NLP pipeline for Amazon reviews. 81% F1 score detecting fraud patterns. Tableau dashboards to visualize linguistic + behavioral anomalies.

**[NBA Playoff Predictor](https://github.com/nisargakadam/nba-ecf-win-predictor)** → Random Forest on 96+ playoff games. Feature analysis to understand what actually drives wins when it matters.

**[Government Spending & Labor Study](https://github.com/nisargakadam/Government-Spending-on-FLPR)** → Ridge regression study on policy impact. Clean preprocessing, multicollinearity checks, visual storytelling.
