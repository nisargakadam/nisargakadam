# Hi, I'm Nisarga! ✨ 
### AI Security · Machine Learning · Data Systems

I’m a CS graduate student and data analyst focused on **AI trust, integrity, and model reliability**.  
My work sits at the intersection of:

- **AI Security:** evaluating model robustness, hallucinations, and adversarial behavior  
- **Data Integrity:** anomaly detection, fraud identification, reproducible pipelines  
- **Machine Learning:** predictive modeling, NLP, and real-world analytics  
- **System Reliability:** stress-testing model behavior using structured datasets
