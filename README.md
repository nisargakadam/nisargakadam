# Hi, I'm Nisarga ✨

I turn messy data into decisions people actually use.

## What I Do

I'm a **data analyst** and **CS grad student** who likes questions without obvious answers — the kind that need clean SQL, thoughtful modeling, and a story that sticks.

I work across:
- **Analytics & Reporting** → SQL, Python, dashboards that answer "why" not just "what"
- **Modeling & ML** → Classification, regression, forecasting with emphasis on interpretability
- **Anomaly Detection** → Finding the weird stuff that matters in noisy data
- **Decision Support** → Turning analysis into action for business, product, and ops teams

## Recent Work

**[Adobe Stock Analysis & Risk Modeling](https://github.com/nisargakadam/Adobe-Stock-Price-Trends-Risk-Signals-Analysis)** → Time series analysis with regime detection and predictive ML. Random Forest achieved 74% accuracy in predicting next-day movements. Calculated the Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and identified that intraday volatility is 30x more predictive than any other feature.

**[Predicting Student Test Scores](https://github.com/nisargakadam/Kaggle-Playground-S6E1-Predicting-Student-Test-Scores)** → XGBoost + Ridge stacking for exam score prediction. 5-fold CV with out-of-fold predictions feeding a meta-model. Engineered features with proper preprocessing pipelines. RMSE of 8.76.

**[Fake Review Detection](https://github.com/nisargakadam/Influence-of-Fake-Reviews-on-Quality-Amazon-Product-Recommendation)** → NLP pipeline for Amazon reviews. 81% F1 score detecting fraud patterns. Tableau dashboards to visualize linguistic + behavioral anomalies.
