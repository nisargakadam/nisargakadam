# 🌟 Hi there!

I’m **Nisarga Kadam**, a Computer Science graduate student, AI security enthusiast, and data analyst passionate about building **trustworthy, resilient, and integrity-driven AI systems**.

Having started working with data, analytics, and applied machine learning early in my academic journey—and pairing it with real-world experience across both startups and agency environments—I’ve grown obsessed with understanding how AI systems behave, break, fail, and adapt. My work lives at the intersection of:

- **AI Security & Trust** — adversarial behavior, model robustness, anomaly detection  
- **Data Integrity** — fraud identification, safe pipelines, and reliability testing  
- **Machine Learning** — NLP, predictive modeling, systematic evaluation  
- **Systems Thinking** — stress-testing model behavior in real environments  

As AI becomes embedded in every business process, I’m motivated by one goal:  
**to help build systems that are safer, smarter, and more interpretable.**

I love blending rigorous analysis with creativity, and I have a strong drive to turn complex technical problems into clear, actionable solutions that bridge the gap between technology and business objectives.

# 🔭 Recent Work

### **Market Anomaly Detection Engine (FinTech + AI Security)**  
- Built a Microsoft stock anomaly detector using time-series engineering + Isolation Forest to surface unusual activity patterns, volume/volatility spikes, and abnormal trading regimes.

### **Fake Review Detection — AI Trust & Integrity**  
- Developed an NLP pipeline (HuggingFace BLAiR) to identify fraudulent Amazon reviews (81% F1), uncovering deceptive linguistic patterns and integrity risks.

### **NBA Playoff Predictor**  
- Trained a Random Forest model to analyze 96+ playoff logs, identifying high-impact KPIs and outlier patterns across teams.

### **Economic Modeling — Government Spending & FLFP**  
- Applied Ridge Regression with rigorous integrity checks (multicollinearity, reproducible preprocessing, interpretable coefficients).

# ⚡ Fun Fact  
I love intentionally breaking models—hallucinating, probing, stress-testing, adversarial poking, and then making them stronger, safer, and more aligned.
